# Lock and Key
### A Minecraft 1.14 Spigot Plugin

# Latest Version: 0.1.2

## What does it do ? 
It provides a signless ownership system for almost all interactable items excluding doors.

## How does it work ?
Any supported block can be claimed by using a new item called the key and shift left clickling with it on the block you wish to lock.

## Do I need the key to be able to open the block again ?
NO! Once the block is assigned to a player, the player will always be able to access it with or without the key.

## Can your share owned blocks with other players ?
YES. 

## How do you share owned blocks ?
The owner of the block will need to shift left click the owned block with a new item called the Share Key.

This will then assign the block to the share key.

For other players to gain access to the block they will need to shift right click the Share Key the owner has assigned the chest to.

It is then a good idea once all players have access to the owned block to put the Share Key in the owned block or destroy it so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands!

## How do I install the plugin ?
Go to the release folder and download the lastest version of the plugin.
Then just drag and drop that jar file into your spigot servers plugin folder.

## What versions of Minecraft are supported ?
- 1.14 Java Edition (Spigot Servers)
